          <h1>Rules of rummy</h1>
          <p>
            <strong> What is Rummy?</strong><br />
            Rummy is a card game played by a group of 2-6 people with two
            decks of cards and two jokers. One deck of cards is shuffled and
            dealt with whereas the other, the closed deck which is hidden from
            the players is placed upside down.
          </p>

          <p>
            Players will be discarding the cards from their sets and picking
            up new ones from the closed deck. The basic goal is to make a set
            of 3 or 4 cards of the same rank, or set of sequence cards from
            the same suit. The person with the highest rank set/run will get
            the highest points.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Deck</strong> : A standard deck of cards will have 52
            cards. These cards are categorized into four suits - hearts,
            spades, diamonds, and clubs. Each suite will have 13 cards with
            four faces, King, Queen, Jack, Ace, and nine number cards from 2
            to 10. Two joker cards will be included in the deck taking the
            count to 54.
            <br />
            <strong>One Deck</strong> : On 2 players max table.
            <br />
            <strong>Two Decks</strong> : On 2-6 players max table.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>How points are calculated?</strong>
            <br />
            All face cards (King, Queen, Jack, and Ace) – 10 points each.
            <br />
            Aces – 10 point each.
            <br />
            Number cards – same as the number on the card.
            <br />
            All the points are added to the cumulative score of the player
            until the pre-set target is reached.
          </p>

          <h1>GullyRummy Gameplay</h1>
          <p>
            <strong>Playing the game</strong>
            <br />
            In GullyRummy, the computer chooses the dealer automatically in
            each game. In a 2-player game, each player is alternatively chosen
            and in a 3 or more players’ game, the dealer is chosen in an
            anti-clockwise direction by the computer.
          </p>

          <p>
            Each player is dealt with the required number of cards (13 or 21)
            to start the game. A player can only see his/her cards face up and
            other players' cards are shown face down making them invisible. As
            a player, you will be shown your cards only. Others’ cards will
            not be visible to you.
          </p>

          <p>
            The cards will be dealt to everyone on the table and the rest of
            them are kept at the center of the table to form a closed slot.
            The first card from this slot is opened automatically and placed
            face up. This first card is called, ‘Open Card’.
          </p>

          <p>
            A random card from the closed deck is pulled by the system and
            kept face-up underneath the closed deck making it to the cut-joker
            in the game.
          </p>
          <p>
            Use the ‘sort’ button next to your cards as soon as you receive
            them. They will then be grouped suit-wise.
          </p>
          <p>
            The first player (sitting next to the dealer) will pick a card
            from either the closed deck or open deck to make the right
            combination with the cards in hand. After that, the first player
            should discard one of the cards from his set and the chance is
            passed to the next player on the right to him/her. And the game
            goes on in the same fashion.
          </p>
          <p>
            The cards in the open deck will be visible to all players on the
            table and the cards in the closed deck will always be placed
            face-down. If you pick a card from the closed deck, no other
            player will come to know which card you picked.
          </p>
          <p>
            The card that is discarded by the player will be seen face-up by
            all other players and it can also be seen in history.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>How to win?</strong><br />Players would need to make the
            best combinations of cards in the form of sets or sequence. One
            who declares first and arranges the cards correctly as per the
            rummy game rules wins.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Things to remember</strong> <br />It is mandatory to have
            one pure sequence and one impure sequence with a joker, in a set
            of 13 cards.
          </p>
          <p>
            The rest of the 13 cards can either be sequences, either pure or
            impure or can be sets (could be a set of minimum 3 cards or
            maximum 4 cards).
          </p>
          <p>
            Any number of jokers of any kind (either cut-jokers or printed
            jokers) can be used.
          </p>
          <p>
            A pure or impure sequence should comprise of cards of the same
            suit. Cards of two different suits cannot be used here.

            this skill-game are mentioned below. Check them out before playing
            the game for a better understanding.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Dealing a card</strong><br />
            All the players on the table would be dealt with cards before the
            game starts, as per the regular rummy rules.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Sorting</strong> <br />
            It sorts the received cards suit-wise when the ‘sort’ button is
            clicked.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Picking a card</strong><br />
            The player will be prompted to pick a card when his/her turn
            comes. He/she can pick a card either from the open deck or the
            closed deck on the table by clicking on it.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong> Discarding a card</strong><br />
            The player will be prompted to discard the card from his/her hand
            after picking up the card. This feature is used to dispose of the
            unwanted card from the hand. You can select the unwanted card and
            click the ‘discard' button that appears after selection.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Drop</strong><br />
            While playing the game, any player can withdraw from it in the
            initial stage or middle by choosing the ‘drop’ option. At
            GullyRummy, the player gets two chances to drop out of the game.
            One is at the initial stage of the game which is called "initial
            drop" and others in the middle of the game called "middle drop".
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>When a player drops at the initial stage?</strong><br />
            When a player realizes that his/her cards are not worth playing
            before picking up the card.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>When a player drops in the middle?</strong><br />
            When a player realizes that his/her cards are not worth playing
            even after picking up the card.
          </p>

          <p>
            The ‘drop’ option can be found on the player's icon. Penalty
            points are deducted in both cases depending on the variant of the
            rummy game played. Refer to the ‘Rummy Points System' for complete
            details of drop points.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>How to use a joker?</strong><br />
            Joker card is used as a jack to complete any sequence and/or set
            in a rummy game. Generally, there will be two types of jokers
            available, one that is ‘printed joker' which is available with the
            normal pack of cards and another that is ‘cut joker’ - it changes
            with the rummy game. A player can use the joker by grouping it
            with the set.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Declare</strong><br />
            A player can only win the game after he/she declares the game as
            per the rummy game rules. If a player has all the requirements to
            win a game, he/she can declare the game by selecting an extra card
            and clicking on the ‘declare’ button.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Arrange/Meld</strong><br />
            Melding is a grouping of cards correctly and showing them to the
            other players on the table when declared. The declarer should
            arrange his/her cards first and the other players on the table
            would arrange/meld their cards. The card confirmed for finishing
            cannot be withdrawn by the player, and incorrect grouping can lead
            to points’ deduction. GullyRummy defines a set limit for arranging
            the cards which are shown on the screen. Click on the ‘declare’
            button after arranging/melding is completed.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>How to send cards?</strong><br />
            When a player declares, the other players are also required to
            show their cards as well. Before sending them, they have to
            arrange them as the declarer does. After the declarer gets
            validated, other players will be displayed ‘declare’ button on
            their screens. The other players’ cards will be declared even if
            the ‘declare’ button is not clicked within the given counting
            downtime.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Multiplier</strong><br />
            GullyRummy can be played at different cash levels. The points won
            or lost will be calculated depending on the multiplier of the
            game. The multiplier can be set at 0.5x, 1x, 2x, and so on,
            defines how much a player can win/lose.
          </p>

          <p>
            E.g., In a 1x 13-card game, if player A gives 20 penalty points to
            player B, then player B will be credited with Rs.20. In the same
            way, in a 2x 13-card game, if player A gives 20 penalty points to
            player B, then player B will be credited with Rs.40 (20 points X
            2).
